// Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
Console.Write("Congratulations!");
Console.Write(" ");
Console.Write("You wrote your first lines of code.");


Console.WriteLine("Congratulations!");
Console.Write("You wrote your first lines of code.");
// This code helps demonstrate the difference between the two methods. A new line is appended by Console.WriteLine(), and Console.Write() prints the output on the current line.
